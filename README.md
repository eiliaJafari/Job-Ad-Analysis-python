# Job-Ad-Analysis-python
## Analysing the job ads to gain some great insights

### Intro
In this project, after performing several pre-processing steps, I analyzed the data of Quera job advertisements. This dataset contains job ads registered in Quera. 
To protect the companies' privacy, the ID of the companies registering the ad has been removed from the dataset. 
Each line of this data set is a job ad that a company intends to recruit for.
This project is compiled in two parts: pre-processing and analysis.
First, I will do the preprocessing steps, then I will go to the analysis step.

### The Dataset 
The dataset is from Quera's job advertisement: https://quera.org/
